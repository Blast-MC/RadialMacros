This is a simple client mod that adds a “hold key → pick slice → release” wheel for running your own commands. Tap a hotkey (or a mouse button) and a clean radial menu pops in; point at an icon, let go, and the command runs as you: no chat box, no spam, just quick actions.

Features:
- Multiple wheels/groups that you can bind to different keys
- Configurable icons for each macro for easy selection
- Single-key immediate commands (add 1 macro to a group)
- Fully configurable in-game with Minecraft like GUIs

Future Plans:
- Variables in commands
- Command Options (add to chat, copy, etc)
